# Simple implementation of Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) using keras
Simple keras implementation of a generative adversarial neural network, as described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661

# How to run this repo
The best way is to use a virtual environment. If you are not familiar with that you can just install globally the dependancies.  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
